    <h2><a name="deffacts">Deffacts</a></h2>

    <p>With the deffacts construct, a list of facts can be defined which are automatically asserted whenever the reset
    command is performed. Facts asserted through deffacts may be retracted or pattern matched like any other fact. The
    initial fact-list, including any defined deffacts, is always reconstructed after a reset command.</p>

    <p>The syntax of the deffacts construct is:</p>

    <p><code>(deffacts &lt;deffacts-name&gt; [&lt;comment&gt;]<br>
    &nbsp;&lt;RHS-pattern&gt;*)</code></p>
